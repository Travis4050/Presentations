	Protocols
	OSI and TCP/IP Models
	How it works
	Ethernet 
	TCP/IP
--------------------------------------------
Why layered models?
	Networking is complicated. It addresses a large number of issues in both hardware and software.
		What message format will be used between a browser a server?
		How will garbled messages be handled?
		How will addressing be handled?
		How will I avoid sending two messages on the network cable at the same time?
		What will the digital signals on the wire look like?
	Complex problems are best solved by dividing them into many simpler problems
	So we use Layers
		Each layer handles it's particular repsonsibilties
		Each layer communicates with the same layer at the other end of the connection
		Each layer provides services to the layer above and utilizes services from the layer below
------------------------------------------
Protocols
	Protocols (ie. standards) are rules which govern the exchange of messages between computers
	Each layer has protocols that specify how things look and work at that layer
	Some Common Protocols
		Application Layer
			HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, FTP
		Transport Layer
			TCP, UDP
		Network Layer
			IP
--------------------------------
OSI and TCP/IP models
	OSI Model
		"Academic" model, not actually implemented
		Appears in many network courses (textbooks) and cert exams
		Contains 7 layers
	TCP/IP Model
		Used in real world
		Has many similarities to OSI Model
		Contains 4 layers (5 if you include the physical layer)
			[[TCP/IP!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_model]] doesn't actually concern itself with physical stuff like wires, but physical stuff is necessary for networks to work, so a complete networking model needs the physical layer on the bottom.
	[[Layers listed and compared!http://docs.google.com/View?id=ddwpj9wx_332k39z6fn]]
------------------------------------------
How it works
	Message originates at application layer
	Header and Footer (maybe) are added
	Entire message (including header and footer) are passed down to next layer
	Message from upper layer (including header and footer) becomes the data for current layer
	Process repeats at each layer until we get to physical layer
	Message is transmitted across the medium
	Message is received by recipient and passed back up the stack, unpacked as we go up

--------------------------------
Ethernet 
	Operates at Layer 1 & 2
	Created by Xerox in 1973 to replace sneakernet
	Competed against Token Ring for awhile
	Has 6 byte address
		In the Network card's firmware
		referred to as Ethernet, Physical, MAC address
		1st 3 bytes identify manufacturer
		last 3 bytes make it unique
--------------------------------
Why We Need Layer 3/4 Addresses and Protocols
	Issues
		There were (are) several different physical layers
			Ethernet, Token Ring, etc..
		A computer's LAN (i.e. location) can't be identified by it's physical layer address (makes routing impossible)
		The physical layer depends on broadcasts to find each other.  This won't work with huge numbers of computers over long distances
	Layer 3 & 4 facilitates different computers on different LANS with different data link/physical layers to communicate
---------------------------------
History
	There were once 4 common layer 3/4 suites
		TCP/IP (Unix)
		NetBeui (Microsoft)
		IPX/SPX (Novell)
		Appletalk (Apple)
	The internet (Email, then the Web) runs on TCP/IP, and everyone wants/needs those tools, so companies all dropped their suite in favor of TCP/IP
--------------------------------
Basic TCP/IP Properties
	IP Address
		provides unique address for each computer on network
		v4 addresses are a 4 byte "dotted quad" 
		for example: 145.62.1.36
	Subnet Mask
		Specifies which part of IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion
		In classful addressing, 255's followed by 0's
	Gateway
		IP address of the router that packets destined for computers not on the LAN (local network) are sent
	All these properties are configured by the network admin
----------------------------------
Additional Properties
	DNS Server
		IP address of a computer that can determine the IP address of a computer given it's host name
		A computer typically has several DNS server addresses listed in case one is down..
---------------------------------
IP classes (Classful)
	Class A 
		IP: 1-126.h.h.h
		SN: 255.0.0.0
		126 networks, 16M+ H/N
	Class B
		128-191.n.h.h
		SN: 255.255.0.0
		16K Networks, 65K H/N
	Class C
		192-223.n.n.h
		SN: 255.255.255.0
		2M Networks, 256 H/N

--------------------------------
Private IPs
	Private IPs NEVER appear on the internet
	They're used only on private networks
	Computers using them MUST use NAT to connect to the internet
	Class A
		10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255
	Class B
		172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255
	Class C
		192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255
--------------------------------
Classful Addressing Problems
	Classes weren't flexible enough
		There were too few Class A and B networks
		Class A and B networks provided too many hosts
		Class C didn't allow enough hosts
	Solutions
		CIDR (Classless InterDomain Routing) 
		NAT (Network Address Translation)
		IPv6 (IP, version 6)
--------------------------------
CIDR 	
	Allows the break between Network and Host to occur somewhere other than a .
	Resulting subnet masks (when written in Base 10), don't have just 255s and 0s.
	Notation
		IP Address/bits in subnet mask
		For Example:
			12.34.0.0/16
			190.24.56.0/24

--------------------------------
Static Vs Dynamic Addresses
	Static
		Addresses that don't change
		Used by Servers, Printers, etc..
	Dynamic
		Addresses that can change
		Used by client machines
		Typically assigned via DHCP Server
		Or, more rarely, by APIPA (Automatic, Private IP Addressing) process
			Assigns 169.254.x.x address

	IPConfig
	Ping
	TraceRt (trace route)
