Networking Essentials
	Terminology
	Networking Models
	Protocols
	How it works
	TCP/IP
	Ethernet 
--------------------------------
Terminology (simplified)
	LAN - Local Area Network
		All computers on a LAN can communicate directly with one another
	switch - physically connects the computers on the LAN 
	router - connects 2 or more networks together.  
	clients - requests services over the network
		e.g. web browser
	server - provide services over the network
		e.g. web server
--------------------------------------------
Networking Models
	Networking is complicated; it addresses a large number of issues in both hardware and software.
		What message format will be used between a browser a server?
		How will garbled messages be handled?
		How will addressing be handled?
		How will I avoid sending two messages on the network cable at the same time?
		What will the digital signals on the wire look like?
	So it's implemented in layers
		Each layer handles it's particular responsibilties
		Each layer communicates with the same layer at the other end of the connection
		Each layer provides services to the layer above and utilizes services from the layer below
--------------------------------
OSI and TCP/IP models
	OSI Model
		"Academic" model, not actually implemented
		Appears in many network courses (textbooks) and cert exams
		Contains 7 layers
	TCP/IP Model
		Used in real world
		Has many similarities to OSI Model
		Contains 4 layers (5 if you include the physical layer)
			[[TCP/IP!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_model]] doesn't actually concern itself with physical stuff like wires, but physical stuff is necessary for networks to work, so a complete networking model needs the physical layer on the bottom.
	[[Layers listed and compared!http://docs.google.com/View?id=ddwpj9wx_332k39z6fn]]	
------------------------------------------
Protocols
	Protocols (ie. standards) are rules which govern the exchange of messages between computers
	Each layer has protocols that specify how things look and work at that layer
	Some Common Protocols
		Application Layer
			HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, FTP
		Transport Layer
			TCP, UDP
		Network (or Internetwork) Layer
			IP

------------------------------------------
How it works
	Steps taken on origninating computer [[img https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EubWYUs2voFDCBR_-htsxO8rkDADmsI_]]
		Message originates at application layer 
		Important Information (addresses, etc..) is added via Header and/or Footer
		Entire message (including header and footer) are passed down to next layer
		Message from upper layer (including header and footer) becomes the data for current layer
		Process repeats at each layer until we get to physical layer
	Steps taken outside computer
		Message is transmitted across the medium
		Message is received by recipient and passed back up the stack, unpacked as we go up
	[[Diagram of the process!https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1siHLFO9hKgkNJk6pwtuP5zgfx-3NDpkdqxinhZUDHRg/edit]]
--------------------------------
Application layer
	Creates/Receives application messages (i.e. the "message" that is to be sent across the network)
	Examples include:
		Simple web page requests
		Resulting web page (.html file)
		A picture (.jpg file)
		A music file (.mp3 file)
	The client/server application layer must format all messages according to the protcol being used
--------------------------------
Transport/Network layers	
	There have been several protocol suites that handled these layers
		NetBeui (Microsoft)
		IPX/SPX (Novell)
		TCP/IP (Unix)
	The first two are basically obsolete, TCP/IP now is the one used by everyone
		Transport layer is handled by TCP (or UDP)
		Network layer is handled by IP
--------------------------------
Layer details
	Transport layer
		Handles application addressing, sequencing, and error handling
			If message is too long it's broken into transportable sized segments
			Sequence numbers are attached to each segment so it can be reassembled in the proper order by the recipient
			a checksum is calculated and attached so if the segment gets corrupted in route that problem can be identified and resolved.
		Protocols: TCP or UDP
	Network layer	
		Handles end-to-end addressing
		Protocol: IP
-------------------------------
Basic TCP/IP Properties
	IP Address
		Provides unique address for each computer on network
		v4 addresses are a 4 byte "dotted quad" 
			for example: 145.62.1.36
	Subnet Mask
		Specifies which part of IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion
		In binary, the subnet mask is all 1's followed by all 0's
		In classful addressing the breaks between 1's and 0's happen at the byte boundries, so in base 10 it's 255's followed by 0's
	Gateway
		IP address of the router that packets destined for computers not on the LAN (local network) are sent
	All these properties are configured by the network admin
----------------------------------
Additional Properties
	DNS Server
		IP address of a computer that can determine the IP address of a computer given it's host name
		A computer typically has several DNS server addresses listed in case one is down..

--------------------------------
IP Commands
	ipconfig (ifconfig on Linux)
		allows you to view/configure IP settings
	ping
		basic testing command to check if two computers can communicate
		required firewall to allow command to be responded to
	tracert (trace route on Linux)
		traces the route across the network/internet a packet takes to reach the destination
	arp (address resolution protocol)
		displays and modifies current mac/IP address mappings
----------------------------------
Data Link/Physical Layers
	Handles direct delivery of messages between two directly connected computers
	Ethernet is the common technology used at these levels in a LAN
	Ethernet has it's own addressing scheme (separate and distinct from TCP/IP)
	Why multiple addresses?
		There were (are) several different physical layers
			Ethernet, Token Ring, etc..
		A computer's LAN (i.e. location) can't be identified by it's physical layer address (makes routing impossible)
		The physical layer depends on broadcasts to find each other.  This won't work with huge numbers of computers over long distances
	Layer 3 & 4 facilitates different computers on different LANS with different data link/physical layers to communicate
--------------------------------
Ethernet 
	Operates at Layer 1 & 2
	Created by Xerox in 1973 to replace sneakernet
	Competed against Token Ring for awhile
	Has 6 byte address
		In the Network card's firmware
		referred to as Ethernet, Physical, MAC address
		1st 3 bytes identify manufacturer
		last 3 bytes make it unique
