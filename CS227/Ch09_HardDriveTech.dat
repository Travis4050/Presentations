	Storage Mechanism [[img images/Drives.jpg]]
		Traditional HDD - Magnetic Platters 
		Solid State Drive - Flash memory
	Bus/Interface (data connnection) 
		Parallel ATA 
		Serial ATA
		Others
	RAID
------------------------------------------
Magnetic Platter Drives
	Drives Geometry consists of [[img http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Cylinder_Head_Sector.svg/360px-Cylinder_Head_Sector.svg.png]]
		Heads (platters * 2)
		Cylinders (tracks)
		Sectors
	ZBR ([[Zone Bit Recording!http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/tracksZBR-c.html]]) makes number of sectors not the same for all cylinders [[img images/zbr.jpg ]]
	LBA - Logical Block Addressing [[img http://www.pcstats.com/articleimages/201201/seagate3TBxt_LBA2.jpg]]
	Spindle Speeds
		5400
		7200
		10000
		15000
-------------------------------------------
Solid State Drives
	Have no moving parts [[img images/SSD.jpg]]
	Advantages
		Use Flash memory to store data
		Much Faster than traditional HDDs
		Noiseless
	Disadvantage
		More Expensive than traditional HDDs
	Types of NAND
		MLC - Multi-level cell
			Slower, but less expensive
		SLC - Single-level cell
			Faster, but more Expensive
	Lifespan is determined by maximum# read operations per cell
		When it reaches EOL, you'll still be able to read it
-------------------------------------------
Common Terms	
	IDE - Integrated Drive Electronics
	ATA - Advanced Technology Attachment
	EIDE - Enhanced IDE
	SATA - Serial ATA
	PATA - Parallel ATA
		This term came about when SATA was invented
		The terms PATA, IDE, and EIDE, are often times used interchangeably
-------------------------------------------
ATA History / Versions
	ATA-1 (IDE) - Only supported 2 drives (504MB), utilized CHS
	ATA-2 (EIDE/ATAPI)  - Suported 4 drives (8.4GB), utilzed LBA
	ATA-3 - Introduced [[S.M.A.R.T.!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.]]
	ATA-4 - faster [[img images/PataCable.jpg]]
	ATA-5 - 66 MBps (ATA/66) - needed 80 wire cable
	ATA-6 - 100 MBps (ATA/100) - allowed drives > 128 GB
	ATA-7 - introduced SATA
--------------------------------------------
PATA overview 
	Utilizes 40 or 80 wire cable [[img images/PATA_Cable.png]]
		Remove connector via handle, or distribute force across cable.
	Motherboard may have two interfaces (channels) [[img images/PATA_Cable2.jpg]]
		Primary
		Secondary
	Each interface supports two drives
		Master
		Slave
	Setting the drive to "CS" allowed would cause it to be configured as either Master or Slave depending on it's position on the Cable (assuming it was a Cable Select cable)
--------------------------------------------
SATA overview
	Utilizes thin data cable [[img http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2005/11/23/pc_interfaces_101/hdd_sata_connected2.jpg]]
	Potentially Hot-swappable
	Much faster than PATA
	Versions
		Note: all speeds are given in bits, not Bytes.  And 1.5Gb/s was roughly equivalent to 150 MB/s of actual data transfer once overhead was accounted for.  Same applies to other speeds.
		SATA I - 1.5 Gb/s (150 MB/s)
		SATA II - 3 Gb/s (300 MB/s)
		SATA III - 6 Gb/s (600 MB/s) 
		SATAe (SATA 3.2) - 16 Gb/s (2 GB/s)
			New (backwards compatible) connector
		eSATA - external SATA, 2 meter shielded cable
---------------------------------------------
AHCI
	BIOS can support SATA drives typically in three modes
		Parallal ATA Emulation (may be called compatibility mode)
		AHCI - [[Advanced Host Controller Interface!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHCI]]
		RAID - Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
	AHCI 
		is configured in BIOS
		supported in Vista/7/10
		necessary if hot-swappablility is to be implemented
-------------------------------------------
Interface Summary
	Bus (data connnection or interface)
		HDD
			PATA (Parallel ATA)
			SATA (Serial ATA)
			eSATA  (External SATA, this is not SATAe)
			USB (external)
			Serial Attached SCSI, (SAS)
		SDD
			PATA (Parallel ATA)
			SATA (Serial ATA)
			USB (external)
			SATAe (SATA 3.2, PCIe lanes on SATA connectors)
			mSATA (mini-SATA, PCIe lanes on special slot)
			M.2 (replaces mSATA, uses PCIe lanes on special slot)
			U.2, (was SFF-8639, uses PCIe 3.0 x4, better thermal)
			NVMe (replaces U.2, M.2. uses PCIe lanes)
-------------------------------------------
RAID
	Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks [[img images/raid0.png]]
	RAID 0 - Striping 
		Requires 2+ drives
	RAID 1 - Mirroring/Duplexing 	[[img images/raid1.gif]]
		Requires 2 drives
	RAID 5 - Striping with parity 	[[img images/raid5.png]]
		Requires 3+ drives
	RAID 6 - Striping with extra parity
		Requires 4+ drives (book says 5+)
	Nested RAID 
		RAID 10 (1+0) Striping of mirrored drives
		RAID 0+1 Mirroring of striped drives
		[[Others!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_RAID_levels]]
--------------------------------------------
RAID Misc
	Duplexing - RAID 1 with double hardware
		2 Drives
		1 cable and 1 disk controller per drive
		Improved performance and redundancy
	JBOD - Just a Bunch Of Disks (many disk ports)
	Hot Spare - Self healing
	RAID options - Hardware vs Software vs BIOS 
		Hardware RAID - Costly, fast, more RAID types, more interfaces, live mod of RAID type, hot spare, transferable.  Replacement risk.
		Software RAID - Cheap.  Less fast.  Less risk.
		BIOS RAID - Cheap.  May be less fast.  Not transferable.
