<h2> Course Info</h2>

<p><b>Course Description:</b> An in-depth course in computer hardware. Covers operational concepts, identification, installation, configuration, and troubleshooting of power supplies, motherboards, microprocessors, memory modules, disk drives, optical drives, and expansion cards.  This course, in conjunction with CS-228, covers the topics on the CompTIA A+ certification exam.</p>

<p><b>Course Objectives:</b> Upon completion of this course, each student should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>explain and implement proper safety procedures when working with computer components
</li>
<li>use PC repair tools, techniques, and procedures appropriately</li>
<li>explain concepts, organization, and operation of PC hardware and associated software</li>
<li>identify different case, power supply, and motherboard form factors and components</li>
<li>identify PC hardware components, and explain the advantages and disadvantages of different types of components</li>
<li>upgrade a computers power supply, CPU, memory, disk drives, video cards, and other internal components</li>
<li>completely disassemble and reassemble a PC</li>
<li>diagnose and repair common hardware and driver problems</li>
<li>evaluate and select appropriate components to meet a customer's specifications or needs </li>
</ol>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> CS-140 or equivalent experience</p>

<p>The class is offered in a lab environment and is a combination of theory and practice. The student will use the textbook, web research, and interaction with the instructor and fellow students to gain insight into the topics covered. Because of the collaborative nature of the class, and the fact that material will be presented that is not available in the textbooks, regularly attending class is essential.</p>

</div>

<!-- =========== Materials ============ -->
<div id="Materials" class="Content">
<h2> Materials</h2>
<p><b>Textbook:</b> Mike Meyers' CompTIA A+ Certification Exam Guide (220-901 & 220-902) 9th edition</p>
<p>This book is used for both this course (227) and the follow-on course (228, PC Hardware &amp; Repair II)</p>

<p><b>Website:</b> We will be using Moodle for announcements, distribution of class materials, quizzes, and exams. </p>

<p><b>Optional Tools:</b> Technician toolkit (screwdriver, etc.) and anti-static kit (wrist strap, lead, alligator clip).  Additional information will be provided in class.
</p>
</div>

<!-- =========== Grading ============ -->
<div id="Grading" class="Content">
<h2> Grading</h2>
<p>Graded work will consist of labs, quizzes, and exams, weighted as follows:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Labs:</td><td>30%</td></tr>		
<tr><td>Quizzes:</td><td>25%</td></tr>		
<tr><td>Exams:		</td><td>45%</td></tr>	
</table>

<p><b>Labs:</b> Numerous lab exercises will be done during the course.  The labs will consist of hand-on activities and web research/activities.  Many of the lab activities must be done in the lab while the class is in session. If you miss a class, there may not be time to make it up later in the term.</p>

<p><b>Review Quizzes:</b> After reading the chapter, you should take the interactive review quizzes for the chapter.  While the grades on these will not be recorded, similar (or identical!) questions will appear on the in-class chapter quiz.
</p>

<p><b>Chapter Questions:</b>  After reading the chapter, you should read, answer, and understand all the "Multiple-Choice Quiz" questions at the end of the chapter.  These will not be collected or graded, but the questions may appear on the in-class chapter quiz.  </p>

<p><b>In-class Quizzes:</b>  The week after a chapter is covered, a quiz over that chapter will be taken in class.  The questions on this quiz will come from the review quizzes and/or "Multiple-Choice Quiz" questions at the back of each chapter.</p>
   
<p><b>Exams:</b> 2 exams will be given, a midterm and a final.   Details of the exams will be specified in class.</p>

<p>Grading scale: 90%-100% = A, 80%-89.9% = B, 70%-79.9% = C, 60%-69.9% = D, &lt; 60% = F</p>
</div>

<!-- =========== Misc ============ -->
<div id="Misc" class="Content">
<h2> Misc</h2>
<p><b>Attendance:</b> Regular attendance is essential to your success in this course. Students are responsible for everything that takes place during class, whether covered in written materials or not.  Additionally, some of each class day will be devoted to hand-on activities, and if a class must be missed, there will not be time to make up those activities in the future.</p>

<p><b>Professionalism:</b> All participants in the class will are required to conduct themselves in a courteous, professional manner at all times. This includes communications in person, via phone, via e-mail or through an online chat or discussion.</p>

<p><b>Ethics: </b>Plagiarism or cheating of any variety will be dealt with in accordance with the policies expressed in the student handbook. Possible consequences for academic dishonesty are: receiving no credit for the assignment in question, failing the course, and/or appearing before the college disciplinary board.</p>

<p><b>Food / Drink Policy:</b> Eating is not allowed while class is in session.  Drinking beverages is acceptable provided there are not disassembled computers on the tables, the beverage is in a sealable container, and you aren't interfering with the learning environment of the class.</p>

<p><b>Cell Phones:</b> Cell phones should not interfere with the learning environment of the class.  Each time your cell phone rings during class, &frac12;% will be deducted from your final grade.  That's &frac12;% per ring, not per call, and if you phone plays music instead of ringing, every 3 seconds of music will be considered one ring.  If you believe you must have your phone on during class, please discuss this with the instructor before class begins to see if an exception will be allowed.  If the instructor's phone rings, everyone gets &frac12;% added to their final grade.</p>

<p><b>Special Needs:</b> If you are a student with a disability and you believe that your opportunities to be successful in this class are affected by that disability, please contact the Clackamas CC Disability Resource Center.  Their website is <a href="http://www.clackamas.edu/DisabilityResourceCenter/" target="_blank">http://www.clackamas.edu/DisabilityResourceCenter/</a>.</p>

<p><b>Incomplete Grades:</b>  An incomplete grade can be given at the discretion of the instructor if you have satisfactorily (C or better) completed at least 75% of the class work. Arrangements must be made with the instructor before finals week in order to be considered for an incomplete.</p>
